This is an old project I made for school. I used to host it privately on BitBucket because I thought I would evolve this into an actual brawler game, but I moved on to other things. It has some interesting tricks going on, like tweening of tiles' alpha and y values and pixel bender shaders.

# Controls:
* Arrow keys to move and jump
* X to punch

# Interesting files:
* FlxSpriteAppear.hx
* FlxTilemapAppear.hx
* TweenAppear.hx
* RGBShifCont.hx
* TweenHelper class in PlayState.hx
