# [DEMO](https://rawgit.com/Ohmnivore/Thrash/master/export/flash/bin/Thrash.swf)

This is an old project I made for school. I used to host it privately on BitBucket because I thought I would evolve this into an actual brawler game, but I moved on to other things. It has some interesting tricks going on, like tweening of tiles' alpha and y values and pixel bender shaders. There's also some neighbour-sensitive tile parsing.

# Controls:
* Arrow keys to move and jump
* X to punch

# Interesting files:
* FlxSpriteAppear.hx
* FlxTilemapAppear.hx
* TweenAppear.hx
* RGBShifCont.hx
* TweenHelper class in PlayState.hx
* OgmoLoader.hx -> My way of loading Ogmo Editor levels (this is a bit of an old version, I'll upload my newest OgmoLoader.hx as a gist someday)
